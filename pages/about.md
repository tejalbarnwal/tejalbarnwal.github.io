<!-- # **About Me** -->
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>About Me</b></h1>
<br>

#### **Hey there! :wave:**<br>
I am a **Robotics Engineer** at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/newspacert/">Newspace Research and Technologies</a>, an aerospace startup that’s all about defence tech for the Indian army. My playground? Visual servoing with multi-rotors—basically, using vision to make drones smarter, more precise, and downright impressive. When I’m not geeking out at work, you will find me diving into the open-source robotics world, contributing to awesome projects like Ardupilot, Gazebo and OpenMV. Giving back to the community is my jam, and I love being part of this global movement of enthusiasts.

This little corner of the web is my space to share a slice of my mind with the world. You’ll find updates on my life, my professional journey, projects I’m working on, and even some personal musings. So, stick around, explore, and let’s geek out together!:rocket:
      
#### **My Journey**
I completed my undergraduate studies at <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a> in <a href="https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/">Mechanical Engineering</a>, but my curiosity didn’t stop there.
I dove into everything from hobby-based projects—like creating something as simple as a xyloband with op-amps to more impactful work, such as developing haptic feedback paw for legged robots. It’s been quite a journey, starting with zero technical knowledge and growing into the engineer I am today.

Along the way, I had the incredible opportunities of learning from some brilliant minds like Prof. <a href="https://www.autonomousrobotslab.com/">Dr. Kostas Alexis</a>, Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitb.ac.in/arpitasinha">Arpita Sinha</a>, and Prof. <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/people/faculty/abhijit">Abhijit Gogulapati</a>. Plus, I got to team up with some seriously talented peers, representing IIT at national and international robotics challenges. Those were some wild, unforgettable times!

#### **Research Interests**
Right now, I am all about the sweet spot where perception meets planning for small unmanned aerial vehicles.

#### **Beyond Robotics**
While robotics is my primary passion, I am deeply fascinated by machines and creativity in all their forms. Whether it’s the adrenaline of sports, the beauty of art, the rhythm of music, or the sheer awe of aviation, I’m always inspired by people who are out there crushing it. Watching planes take off and land :flight_departure:? Pure magic. Those massive engines defying gravity? A physics-based miracle. And when I need a boost, I crank up The Fatrat or Alan Walker—instant joy! Oh, and I’m always down for a game of badminton. :badminton:

For me, learning is fun, but applying that knowledge to solve real-world problems or to create smething new out of it? That’s where the real thrill is. I’m all about connecting the dots—seeing how small steps lead to big, game-changing goals.
