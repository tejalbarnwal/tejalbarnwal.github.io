# Intelligent Picking Robot - Flipkart Grid 2.0

## Abstract
This problem statement tries to replicate the quintessential warehouse problem of picking in which the participants are supposed to build their own robot hardware and software (collectively, a “Robot”) that is capable of doing general tasks of picking items from a pick area and place them into a cell in th drop/stow area. There are few households objects at a height of 100cm from the ground on a table, which is termed as the pick up area. We have to design a mechanism which can pick up these objects and then put them in a stow area in a particular manner.
